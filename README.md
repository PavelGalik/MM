These scripts were used for the diploma thesis that dealt with multiple myeloma segmentation in the whole-body CT data.
The trained models are available at:

MATLAB:

evaluation -> script for DICE and FNR computation

Python:

autoRename -> script for automatical renaming of files

autoRenameMask -> script for automatical rename of mask files

CT_croping_spine_segment -> cropping the CT data according to the spinal mask (different segments of the spine)

main -> script for automatical cropping and saving the MM images, labels, and masks

rename_labels -> script for automatical labels rename

spine_segment -> script for defining each spinal segment according to numbers of vertebrae in the CT scans
